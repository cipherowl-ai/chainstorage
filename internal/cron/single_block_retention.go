	// The probe's cost is NOT bounded by the undeleted backlog alone, which is

	// dropping the floor to 0 in production. The due-cohort query joins its
	// due_keys CTE back to block_consolidation_shadow to expand each cohort,
	// and that join is bounded only by the height range: measured on
	// solana-mainnet prod, past roughly 1.5M heights of width the planner
	// abandons idx_block_consolidation_shadow_tag_height for a sequential scan
	// of the whole table and the probe stops finishing inside its 60s statement
	// timeout. A fixed floor widens at the chain's block rate and reaches that
	// point unaided (INF-1330).
	//
	// The watermark is the lowest height still holding an undeleted single-block
	// object, so it tracks live work and holds the range at the retention delay
	// expressed in blocks. It is recomputed every tick rather than persisted:
	// a stored floor would need its own reconciliation for repairs and failed
	// sweeps, and a stale one strands data silently.
	//
	// With PersistFloorWatermark on, the walk is BOUNDED and its progress is
	// persisted (INF-1571). The unbounded walk from approved_start_height
	// re-scans every row retention has already retired, and that count grows
	// at the drain rate — on robinhood-mainnet it crossed the 60s statement
	// timeout at ~6.6M rows and stalled retention for 12h twice (INF-1569).
	// Instead the walk starts from the persisted floor (the approval floor
	// when there is none) and proceeds one bounded chunk at a time, raising
	// the persisted floor past every chunk that holds no undeleted row, up to
	// a per-tick chunk budget. Each chunk is a fixed cost inside the statement
	// timeout and each empty chunk's result is durable before the next one
	// runs, so a first rollout from an old approval floor, or a lost cursor,
	// is a walk that spans a few ticks instead of a query that can never
	// finish, and a tick cut off mid-walk resumes where it stopped. The walk
	// is capped at approvedEnd: rows above it are outside the sweep's range,
	// and a walk that reaches it having found nothing proves every approved
	// row retired, so the floor moves to approvedEnd and the next tick walks
	// only what the envelope gained since — the fully-retired state costs a
	// constant, never a re-scan of the retired tail.
	//
	// The persisted floor is only ever a starting point for the same walk,
	// never a substitute for it: reconcileFloorWatermark re-checks the range
	// beneath it one bounded chunk per tick, so a stray row that appears
	// below (a repair, a re-ingest at an old height) lowers the floor within
